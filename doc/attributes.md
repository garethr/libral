# Resource attributes

Every provider defines, as part of its [metadata](metadata.md), what
attributes it has and, for each of them, their data type and whether that
attribute can be read or written. A complete example can be found
[here](../examples/providers/metadata.yaml)

There is one attribute that every resource needs to have: `name`, which
must be of type `string`. This attribute can not be changed through
`update`. It serves as a primary key for the resource among all the
resources managed by a specific provider.

If the provider can create and/or delete resources, the attribute
controlling that must be called `ensure` and must accept, at a minumum, the
values `present` (create if not existent) and `absent` (delete if it
already exists)

The attribute names `ral` and any names starting with `ral_` and `__` (two
underscores) are reserved, and must not be used as attribute names.

## Specifying provider attributes

Provider attributes are specified in the YAML metadata that the `describe`
action for each provider returns.

```yaml
---
provider:
  ... general provider metadata ...
  attributes:
    name:
      desc: <description of name in the context of this provider>
    <attr1>:
      desc: <description of attr1>
      type: <data type>
      kind: <attr kind>
    ...
    <attrN>:
      desc: <description of attrN>
      type: <data type>
      kind: <attr kind>
```

### The data type
The `<data type>` of the attributes uses a small subset of the [Puppet 4
type system](https://docs.puppet.com/puppet/latest/lang_data_type.html). Currently
supported are the following data types:

* `string`: a string of characters
* `boolean`: either `true` or `false`
* `array[string]`: an array of strings (note that only arrays of strings
  are currently supported)
* `enum[<option>, (<option>, ...)]`: a string that is exactly one of the
  `<option>`

If no `type` is given for an attribute, the type defaults to `string`

### The kind

The `<attr kind>` indicates whether an attribute can be read or
written. The possible values are:

* `r`: the attribute is readonly; such an attribute will be reported back
  when reading a resource via `instances` or `find`, but can not be changed
  with `update`
* `w`: the attribute can only be written; that means that such an attribute
  will not be reported from `instances` or `find`, but can be changed with
  `update`
* `rw`: the attribute can both be read and written

If no `<attr_kind>` is provided, it defaults to `rw`.

*Note*: the idea behind introducing a 'kind' (terrible name) is to ease
some of the confusion between property and parameter, which correspond to
`rw` and `w` kinds, and provide a clean way to also have readonly
attributes

## TODO

* we need a way to indicate mandatory vs optional attrs (for writing)
* we use `type` both for the data type and the provider type
* we will, at some point, need to support more than these types; though it
  does not make sense to support the full Puppet type system as some of it
  only applies to catalogs etc. and there is no notion of that in `libral`
* how strict should checking be ? In some cases, it's preferrable to allow
  passing readonly attributes to `update` (so you can do `find`/change a
  couple attributes/`update`) but it might also lead people astray when
  they try to write a file's `mtime` and nothing happens.
